      <li>3 eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit

        Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned,
        2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; set aside.

        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
